### Bio

Hi, I am an second year Ph.D. student in the [LLM for Software Engineering Lab (LLMSE)](https://base.sjtu.edu.cn/home/doku.php?id=start), affiliated with the School of Software at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. I'm grateful to be advised by [Prof. Xiaodong Gu](https://guxd.github.io/) and [Prof. Beijun Shen](https://base.sjtu.edu.cn/home/doku.php?id=mem:bjshen).

I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) in 2022.

My main research interests are in the field of Natural Language Processing and Software Engineering. 
Some of my recent projects can be found in my Github homepage [here](https://github.com/YerbaPage). Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work or have any questions.
